# PianoMirrorGooglePlay
Android version of Kundalini Piano Mirror

# Notes
* This code is based on the Android "MidiScope" example from Google, which can be found here: https://github.com/philburk/android-midisuite
* This code is a total hack, and not well-implemented. I literally just inserted the ability to do the mirroring in whatever weird way I could find to make it work within the context of the Midiscope example code. If somebody wants to rewrite this, it would be great. For now it works, and that is enough for me.
* In my testing, it is better to just use a midi-to-USB cable. It is possible to use a BTLE dongle [after pairing one] but from my testing, it is too slow to use.
